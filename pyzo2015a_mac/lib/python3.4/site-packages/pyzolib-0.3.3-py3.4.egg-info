Description:  Package pyzolib
        
        The pyzolib package provides basic functionality for the Pyzo environment.
        It contains a collection of modules and small packages that should be
        imported as "from pyzolib import xxx"
        
        The packages currently are:
          * path - object oriented path processing (no more os.path.x)
          * paths - Get paths to useful directories in a cross platform manner.
          * qt - Proxy for importing QtCore et al. from PySide or PyQt4
          * ssdf - the Simple Structured Data Format (for config files and 
            scientific databases)
          * insertdocs - a sphynx pre-processor to include docstrings in the text,
            allowing readthedocs.org to host the docs without requiring importing code.
          * pyximport - for easy on the fly compilation of Cython, using the Pyzo 
            environment to establish the location of a gcc compiler.
          * gccutils - used by the above to manage the gcc compiler.
          * interprerers - list the Python interpreters available on this system.
          * dllutils - utilities to set the RPATH in dynamic libararies and 
            remove depndencies on the MSVCR from the embedded manifest.
          * shebang - for making shebangs in pyzo distro absolute.
