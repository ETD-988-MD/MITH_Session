Description: =========
        conda-env
        =========
        
        Provides the `conda env` interface to Conda environments.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        To install `conda env` with conda, run the following command in your root environment: 
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ conda install -c conda conda-env
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        All of the usage is documented via the ``--help`` flag.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ conda env --help
            usage: conda-env [-h] {create,export,list,remove} ...
        
            positional arguments:
              {create,export,list,remove}
                create              Create an environment based on an environment file
                export              Export a given environment
                list                List the Conda environments
                remove              Remove an environment
                update              Updates the current environment based on environment file
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
        
        ``environment.yml``
        -------------------
        conda-env allows creating environments using the ``environment.yml``
        specification file.  This allows you to specify a name, channels to use when
        creating the environment, and the dependencies.  For example, to create an
        environment named ``stats`` with numpy and pandas create an ``environment.yml``
        file with this as the contents:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            name: stats
            dependencies:
              - numpy
              - pandas
        
        Then run this from the command line:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ conda env create
            Fetching package metadata: ...
            Solving package specifications: .Linking packages ...

            #
            # To activate this environment, use:
            # $ source activate numpy
            #
            # To deactivate this environment, use:
            # $ source deactivate
            #
        
        Your output might vary a little bit depending on whether you have the packages
        in your local package cache.
        
        You can override the name of the created channel by providing either ``-n`` or
        ``--name`` and a valid environment name.  Likewise, you can explicitly provide
        an environment spec file using ``-f`` or ``--file`` and the name of the file you
        would like to use.
