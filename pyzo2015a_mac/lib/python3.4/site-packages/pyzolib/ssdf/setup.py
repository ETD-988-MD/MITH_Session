Simple Structured Data Format
-----------------------------
Ssdf is a simple format for stroring structured data. It supports
seven data types, two of which are container elements:
None, int, float, (Unicode) string, numpy array, list/tuple, dict/Struct.

One spec, two formats
---------------------
Ssdf is actually two formats: the original text format is human readable,
and thus enables inspecting databases and data structures using a simple
text editor. The binary format is more efficient and uses compression on
the whole file (the text format only compresses arrays). It is more suited
for storing really large databases or structures containing large arrays.
Both formats are fully compatible.

Notes
-----
SSDF comes as a single module. While it's a bit big (approaching 2k lines), 
it enables easier deployment inside a package in a way that works for 
Python 2 as well as Python 3.
