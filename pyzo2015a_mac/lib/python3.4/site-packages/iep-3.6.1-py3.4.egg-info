Description:  Package iep
        
        IEP (pronounced as 'eep') is a cross-platform Python IDE focused on
        interactivity and introspection, which makes it very suitable for
        scientific computing. Its practical design is aimed at simplicity and
        efficiency.
        
        IEP is written in Python 3 and Qt. Binaries are available for Windows,
        Linux, and Mac. For questions, there is a discussion group.
        
        Two components + tools
        ----------------------
        
        IEP consists of two main components, the editor and the shell, and uses
        a set of pluggable tools to help the programmer in various ways. Some
        example tools are source structure, project manager, interactive help,
        and workspace.
        
        Some key features
        -----------------
        
          * Powerful *introspection* (autocompletion, calltips, interactive help)
          * Allows various ways to *run code interactively* or to run a file as a
            script.
          * The shells runs in a *subprocess* and can therefore be interrupted or
            killed.
          * *Multiple shells* can be used at the same time, and can be of different
            Python versions (from v2.4 to 3.x, including pypy)
          * Support for using several *GUI toolkits* interactively: PySide, PyQt4,
            wx, fltk, GTK, Tk.
          * Run IPython shell or native shell.
          * *Full Unicode support* in both editor and shell.
          * Various handy *tools*, plus the ability to make your own.
          * Matlab-style *cell notation* to mark code sections (by starting a line
            with '##').
          * Highly customizable.
